# Adam Landberg's Reflection - week 5

Weeky individual reflection, week 5, Adam Landberg

## What do I want to learn or understand better?

A: I am unsure if we have a scaleable service.

B: We have a scaleable service that is adaptable for different customer needs.

A->B: I would like to understand how we efficiently can tailor the service to eventual different customers to make the service scaleable.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

A: We do not have the commerzialisation of the service in mind, and we are mostly focusing on delivering to our cuustomer forgetting our customer is a customer.

B: We treat our customer as one of our customers, and understand that we might have other potential customers that also would be interested in our product/service.

A->B: I bring up my knowledge in commerzialisation in the team.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

A: The stories are a little broad.

B: The stories are a tailored for one task, and one task only.

A->B: I cut the stories to only cover one specific scope.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

A: I have not yet done the "real" I-division things in the project.

B: I would like our team to deliver the best concept at the end of the project.

A->B: I should bring in my competence from the I-division to my team.

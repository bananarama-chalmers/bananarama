# Adam Landberg's Reflection - week 7

Weeky individual reflection, week 7, Adam Landberg

## What do I want to learn or understand better?

A: We have been discussing how to measure our work and how to keep track of us being on the right track, for example through KPIs. Our KPIs have not been properly defined yet.

B: It is clear what the KPIs stands for, and the KPIs are used to reach our goal with the final delivery.

A->B: Make sure to find suggestions on how to use SCRUM efficiently, and try to put it in our context.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

A: We are heading towards delivery to client, and we need to meet the client’s needs.

B: Everybody in the team understand how to deliver something to client and how to do it in a way that is “selling”.

A->B: I take the lead in the project when we discuss how we should do the delivery of the service to our client, and hope that the other team members would be interested in having the conversation about so with me.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

A: As of today we have been creating most of the projects parts, which means that the project is heading towards delivery. This means we have to finalise the project. I, as the product owner, is therefore responsible for our coming delivery.

B: I can be safe knowing that all of the sprints we have started have been finalised as planned, and that the user stories presented is relevant to satisfy our client.

A->B: I question our planning when having our SCRUM-planning meetings to assure us being on the right track.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

A: Our solution does ot have any information page or contact page yet.

B: We have an information page and a contact page.

A->B: I and a team mate make sure that we get this page ready, and proposes it as a user story for us to work on.

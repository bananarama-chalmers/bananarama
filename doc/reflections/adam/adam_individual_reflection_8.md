# Adam Landberg's Reflection - week 8

Weeky individual reflection, week 8, Adam Landberg

## What do I want to learn or understand better?

A: The functionality of our service is more and more getting to its final state. We have an algorithm that works in good ways for the potential user. As we, from the beginning, have designed the service for computer use I would also like to know if and how we can make the service work on mobile devices too.

B: I know how to make sure that our service works on mobile devices, and I understand the difference between usability on computer (through the use of a mouse) and the usability on a mobile device (through the use of a finger).

A->B: I engage in the final development of our service and question whether the service should be useable also on mobile devices.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

A: We are now heading towards the delivery to the client and in the course. I have previously worked with deliveries to clients. That has given me competences in the field of deliverables, and how to meet a client’s needs.

B: I can feel assured that my peer group members feel safe and secure in how to deliver to a client. The delivery to our client has been made in accordance to proper delivery methods and the whole group has, through my leadership as the leader of the group, acquired the competence of delivery.

A->B: I take the leading role in our creation of the final delivery to our client. The packing of the service and its coherence to our established brand is clear. I assure that I teach my group members that want to learn about branding and launch, and I check with my group how we would like to deliver the piece of art we have created.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

A: Our team is now heading towards the end of our project and we have recognised that there are stories that we have not yet worked on. When we did our latest prioritisation of our work we understood that some stories might not be worked on.

B: We have finalised the service on the level that it satisfies the need of our client, even though we might have stories left on the SCRUM board.

A->B: I understand the reason of using SCRUM and make sure that we, as a group, follow the rules of SCRUM. We should not compromise with our own time, our need to deliver to client nor the needs of the client. I make sure that I and the group understand the importance of and the learning opportunity in using the SCRUM board.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

A: I have been actively engaged in our creation of the interface of our service. I have contributed with my competence in design and branding which have created a clear concept that we now call DiDRiK.

B: DiDRiK is a well established brand of ours with a clear meaning for the client. The brand is clearly communicated throughout the whole project, as well as clear to the client as well as in our end deliveries in the course. 

A->B: I will contribute with my branding skills to the group, and make sure that the group sees the quality of my competence. I also make sure that the brand, when it now is being finalised, is getting clear in its terms of communication.

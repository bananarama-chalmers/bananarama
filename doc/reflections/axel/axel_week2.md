Using A, B, A->B

Smith states that reflection is "assessment of what is in relation to what might or should be and includes feedback designed to reduce the gap" (R. Smith, Formative Evaluation and the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning, New Directions for Teaching and Learning, vol. 88, 2001, pp. 51-62) which can be boiled down to describing ...

... the current situation or "what is" (A), ... what you want the situation to be or "what might or should be" (B), and ... a plan for getting from where you are to where you want to be or "feedback designed to reduce the gap" (A -> B).

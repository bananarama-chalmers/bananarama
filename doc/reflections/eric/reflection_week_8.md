B: I would like to feel comfortable using React hooks and working on the frontend. 
A->B: I will work together with my team on a frontend story to see their workflow

How can i help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new? 
A: The team do not feel 100% comfortable using the code ive written 
B: I want my team to understand the code i have written
A->B: I will make even more comments in the code describing how it should be used. I will also answer any and all questions regarding my code. 

What is my contributions towards the team's use of Scrum? 
A: I made userstories and participated in the meetings. Also i've done all my userstories that I was assigned to and helped on other peoples stories

What is my contributions towards the team's Deliveries? 
A: A big userstory connecting the frontend with the algorithm for fiding the paths. 
B: I felt like the velocity for this week was a bit low. But we also were assigned 4 people to the userstory since we all have worked on different parts of the code we 
we all needed to be there. 
A->B: Since this was a one time thing i feel like i will try to take on as much velocity as last week in the future.

Weeky individual reflection, week \[2], Ludvig

## What do I want to learn or understand better?

A: I currently know next to nothing about web application development.

B: I want to become more familiar with the technology/languages we will use, such as React and Typescript, and also be more familiar with the use of Github.

A->B: I will study resources on the topic and experiment a bit on my own.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

A: I explain my understanding of things when I have an understanding.

B: I will continue to help when someone does not know something that I do. 

A->B: Business as usual, but also encourage team mates to look at resources I may have found particularly useful.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

A: I have explained my understanding of the different roles in SCRUM, and created a meeting agenda to be followed.

B: I want to help the team get to a point where the use of SCRUM feels natural.

A->B: I will make my team aware if I notice the use of a work methodology that is incoherent with SCRUM.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

A: I created a Business Model Canvas.

B: I want to keep being active in the creation of our deliveries.

A->B: So far so good. Keep taking responsibility for a slice of our total work load.

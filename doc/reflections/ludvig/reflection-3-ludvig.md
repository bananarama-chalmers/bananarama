Weeky individual reflection, week \[3], Ludvig

## What do I want to learn or understand better?

A: I currently know very little about application design and how it is done to aid the development of the actual application.

B: I want to learn more about application design and the tools used (Figma in our case).

A->B: Will sit down with Samuel and learn about Figma while we create an interactive UI-mockup.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

A: I explain my understanding of things when I have an understanding.

B: I will continue to help when someone does not know something that I do. 

A->B: Business as usual, but also encourage team mates to look at resources I may have found particularly useful.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

A: Have participated in the team's reflection regarding our use of Scrum at the end of each week.

B: Contribute with valuable insight into how we can make our work process better.

A->B: Reflect as the week progresses on how our current methodology is working for me and the team as a whole.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

A: Finished the tasks I had been assigned.

B: The tasks I complete should bring value to the team.

A->B: Be aware of the what tasks I can complete within the given timeframe, and take responsibility for these.

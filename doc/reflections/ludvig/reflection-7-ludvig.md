Weeky individual reflection, week [7], Ludvig

## What do I want to learn or understand better?

A: I am currently not that familiar with the different types of functionalities that are offered with the API we have chosen.

B: Will participate in pair programming where we try to utilize the adress autocomplete function offered within the API. I should become more familiar with the use of APIs overall, but also with how auto completing adresses for example actually works.

A->B: By being active in the pair programming, asking questions to try and understand. Also by looking up documentation for the API to help figure out implementation.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

A: I don't know as much about the technical side of our product as the IT-students, but make sure to take the oppurtnity to learn when doing pair programming so that I could be more knowledgable about the technology in the future (if the course would go on).

B: I want to be able to help the team with technical knowledge, but also on the use of scrum.

A->B: Without being too familiar with the technology itself, I can still ask relevant questions that make the group think so that we can together come up with solutions and learn together. Also by taking a personal responsibility to be familiar with scrum-work I can help steer our work methodology in the right direction.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

A: As scrum master I make sure that we reflect as a team on how we can improve our way of working. I am also encouraging and make sure that everybody is on board and are happy with our process.

B: I want be a team member that makes sure we learn the methods taught in this course. 

A->B: By keeping a birdseye view of the project to make sure that all parts (e.g. technical, process, administrative, team spirit) work well together. I do this by being up to date with what everybody are working on and thnking of which reflection points may be valuable to reflect on after any given sprint.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

A: This week was the delivery week of our (I-students) bachelor thesis so me and Adam (I) had limited time to participate in the technical stories, but participated to the ability that I could.

B: I want to keep being part of the more technical stories to learn more about our chosen technology as I was the week before.

A->B: By undertaking technical stories and doing pair programming with an IT-student I will be able to learn about our technology, how the code works, and how it all fits together. Ask questions, look up documentation, and think about the code together.

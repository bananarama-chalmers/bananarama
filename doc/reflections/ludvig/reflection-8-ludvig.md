Weeky individual reflection, week \[8], Ludvig

## What do I want to learn or understand better?

A: I currently have a very vague idea of how al different components of the software work in conjunction with one another.

B: As we head to wards the end of the project, I want to become more familiar with the codebase as a whole; how different components fit together to form the complete product.

A->B: By studying our git repo and asking for clarification from someone who is more familiar with a specific component.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

A: There is not much time left but we have begun slighly with the final report, so I am encouraging discussions about some specific points.

B: I want the team to feel that we have reflected well on the different points in the final report.

A->B: Coming up with relevant questions we can discuss, drawing inspiration from online resources.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

A: Make that we discuss relevant things in our sprint plannings and sprint reviews.

B: I want the scrum methodology to be a natural part of our work and for it to not feel like a burden. Coming up on the last week, it feels it has worked quite well.

A->B: Read online resources and keep a birdseye view of the project.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

A: Have been mostly engaged with the UI development of the app but have been participating in some more technical stories as well.

B: More technical work.

A->B: Out of sprints now, but would undertake more technical stories.

# Samuel Kajava's Reflection - week 1

Weeky individual reflection, week 1, Samuel Kajava

## What do I want to learn or understand better?

A: I don't understand scrum enough to feel comfortable in applying it, regarding scrum masters and other roles.

B: I want to understand how the scrum master handles leading sprints as well as contributing to the codebase.

A->B: I will read the scrum document provided on canvas to get a better grasp of the process.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

A: I feel like I have good knowledge of git, and think I can be of help regarding VC and CI.

B: I want the team to be comfortable in using git if they feel like they aren't.

A->B: I will make it clear that I welcome questions regarding git throughout the whole project.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

A: I have set up the repo and made a template to streamline these individual reflections, and I think this enables us to utilize our usage of scrum.

B: I want to be able to discuss and reflect with the other team members to feel like we're making progress and are doing things we feel good about.

A->B: I will keep doing this work regarding repo structure so we can focus on learning new stuff together, if people are okay with that.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

A: I was late to writing our contract but read through it and signed when I felt like I agreed to the contents. I have provided a template for our reflections, hopefully making it easier to do.

B: I want to be on time and be sure of when our deadlines are to ensure us being on track at all times.

A->B: By writing down time and dates for when our meetings occur and having a clear list of deadlines will increase my contribution to our deliveries.

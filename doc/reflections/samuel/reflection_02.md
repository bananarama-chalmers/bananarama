# Samuel Kajava's Reflection - week 2

Weeky individual reflection, week 2, Samuel Kajava

## What do I want to learn or understand better?

A: I do not know enough about weighted graphs.

B: I want to know enough about implementing graphs to be able to do it in typescript, despite not having much experience in the language.

A->B: I will reduce the gap between A and B by first implementing it in an environment I'm comfortable with (JavaScript)

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

A: Some teammates have said they are unsure about using react and typescript, I want to help them feel more comfortable.

B: All devs are comfortable with using typescript and know where to look when needing to learn more.

A->B: By providing resources to learn stuff I will reduce the gap, also making sure people know that they always can contact me if they need guidance.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

A: I have written user stories creating dev value and added them to the product backlog and discussed how to use scrum with my team.

B: I want to add items to the product backlog which provide user value rather than just giving dev value.

A->B: Talking to the team when planning the coming scrum we'll find a strategy for writing good stories that create user value, since I think it's a bit hard to do in this stage of the project.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

A: I have written user stories, created a mockup and helped with the repo.

B: I want to contribute to the code base so we have some foundation for continuing the progress in the project.

A->B: By writing code and talking with my teammates on the next meeting to plan out where to go from here, we need to make some way of displaying the structure.

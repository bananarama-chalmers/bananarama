# Samuel Kajava's Reflection - week 3

Weeky individual reflection, week 3, Samuel Kajava

## What do I want to learn or understand better?

A: At the moment I am unsure of how TypeScript should be used in terms of OOP.

B: I want to have a clear understanding of how I should use it - should I go with classes or try to make everything into functional variables?

A->B: My reading best practices from Microsoft and looking at open source projects I will get a better understanding I think.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

A: I feel like people are, just like me, new to TypeScript.

B: I want us all to be on the same level so we can work together effectively.

A->B: By sharing my progress and providing good resources for learning TypeScript.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

A: I have followed the steps we have decided for each sprint and participated in the meetings, providing ideas.

B: I want to keep doing what I have been doing, and improve our workflow by reflecting on what can become even better in our process for each sprint.

A->B: By reflecting over how it has worked, and see if there are improvements to be made somewhere.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

A: I have finished all my user stories + tasks for this sprint.

B: I want to make more progress personally, each sprint, sicne the workload was too light.

A->B: By gradually adding more tasks to my list each sprint, I will find a sweet spot for my performance, resulting in me contributing more.

# Samuel Kajava's Reflection - week 4

Weeky individual reflection, week 4, Samuel Kajava

## What do I want to learn or understand better?

A: I feel like I need to learn more about sessions between different clients and determine if we need to create a backend.

B: I want to be sure on how to overcome our current struggles regarding having several people see the same thing on their screen.

A->B: By looking up similar projects and googling around I will learn how.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

A: I feel like I can teach others in the team how to create components and how to use Tailwind CSS.

B: I want everyone or as many as possible to be comofortable in using our tools.

A->B: By asking on our meetings if people are in need of help in some way I will be able to get to B.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

A: I am following our set guildelines and am making sure to be done with my stuff each week. I feel like I could contribute more by suggesting use of daily standups in some way.

B: I want us all to have better transparency in what we're doing so we know if someone needs backup if they have a hard user story for example.

A->B: By suggesting ot use daily standups I think I will get a conversation started on how we can increase this transparency.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

A: I am doing my stuff on time, but I feel like I can put more on my table, since I get done quickly.

B: I want to have a lot more to do since I feel like I can take it.

A->B: By putting more on my TODO and putting the time in I will reach B. :)

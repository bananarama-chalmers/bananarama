# Samuel Kajava's Reflection - week 5

Weeky individual reflection, week 5, Samuel Kajava

## What do I want to learn or understand better?

A: At the moment, I am not super sure about how to use global states in react, and want to learn Redux.

B: I know how to use Redux and implement a global state for the application which would improve code quality.

A->B: By implementing it and learning at the same time I will create value for the product in more ways than one at the same time.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

A: I am comfortable in a certain way of working with components in react, and I'd like to make my teammates just as comfortable.

B: Everyone is up to speed with this way of working.

A->B: By clearly documenting my code and informing my teammates I will share this knowledge.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

A: I am dedicating myself to the scrum process, especially when assigning user stories to myself. However, I feel like we can get better at acceptance criteria.

B: We have a clear framework for acceptance criteria.

A->B: By talking to the group and our supervisor, I think we could come up with a more clear set of acceptance tests.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

A: I have done my solo work in a way that I am satisified with, but when we are three people on one task I felt not so useful.

B: I continuosly provide value to the team and finish everything I am assigned to each week.

A->B: With this experience in mind with being too many people on one tassk I will make sure to either work solo or with one other person. I will of course keep asking people if something comes up, so I am not isolating myself, just that I think it would be more efficient to work in smaller teams.

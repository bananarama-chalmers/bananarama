# Samuel Kajava's Reflection - week 6

Weeky individual reflection, week 6, Samuel Kajava

## What do I want to learn or understand better?

A: At the moment, I'm not entirely sure on how the backend works.

B: I understand the backend so I can write tessts for it as well as incorperating in with the frontend which I am responsible for.

A->B: By collaborating with Hugo in the next sprint, I think I will bride the gap between A and B.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

A: I feel like I am comfortable in the scrum method, and I think I can help my teammates reaching my level of understanding if they are not as comfortable.

B: Everyone is comfortable with Scrum.

A->B: I think I will reach B by continuing to be active during meetings and sharing my experiences.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

A: I am contributing to the use of Scrum by contributing with user stories and helping others divide them in to smaller stories if they feel too big.

B: We have good acceptance criteria for each story so it is easy to tackle each task.

A->B: By putting more tiem in when writing the stories and asking for help when I am unsure how we should create tasks for a story.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

A: I am contributing a lot at the moment as I have been responsible for the frontend and delivering at it.

B: I am doing more fullstack work and making sure everything works together.

A->B: By sitting with Hugo who has done a lot of work on the backend I think we will reach a good minimal viable product during the next sprint if everything goes according to plan.

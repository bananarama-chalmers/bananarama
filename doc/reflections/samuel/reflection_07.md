# Samuel Kajava's Reflection - week 7

Weeky individual reflection, week 7, Samuel Kajava

## What do I want to learn or understand better?

A: At the moment, I feel like I have good knowledge over the source code. However, I would like to be able to customize CI more efficiently, and how to mock unsupported functions so we can run tests on more parts.

B: I want to have a more useful CI pipeline.

A->B: To reach a better state in our CI, I would have to make research when there is time for it. It might be underprioritized at the moment, however, since we have a deadline and might need to focus on things providing more customer value.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

A: I have most knowledge regarding our frontend, and I feel like I can teach peopåle how it works so they can contribute as well.

B: People from Indek feel comfortable enough to write their own views, or even better, components.

A->B: By utilizing pair programming, I could be of help when they write their code which would help us reach B.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

A: I am using the scrum board in a way that is good for me, which results in it being good for the team, as it is a good tool rather than some obligatory part of the course.

B: I am helping the team by creating better user stories.

A->B: Since I am using the board in a way thats effective for me, it does not mean it is useful for everyone, so by putting aside more time for creating them, I think I would contribute more.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

A: I have done a lot of work on the frontend.

B: I am using the adapter pattern to make it easier to use the model with the components.

A->B: By making a refactor I would reach B, but that is a question of priority.

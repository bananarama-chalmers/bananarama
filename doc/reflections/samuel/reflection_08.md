# Samuel Kajava's Reflection - week 8

Weeky individual reflection, week 8, Samuel Kajava

## What do I want to learn or understand better?

A: At the moment I want to learn more about how to work together and create more vertical slices. Now that the project is coming to an end and we're connecting stuff together, it becomes apparent that we need to think about this the next time. It has resulted in a lot of annoying refactors.

B: I want to know how to incorporate better slicing in coming projects and communicate this with my team.

A->B: By learning from this experience, I will get to B. I now know what we could have done better and by taking this in to account the next time, I'm sure it will be better.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

A: At this point, we don't have much left so it is hard to come up with something, but my reflection from the question above applies, and I can definitely share that insight.

B: My teammates are one the same page as me and we share a common strategy for putting different parts together is a state I would like to be in.

A->B: By sharing my thoughts regarding this, I'm sure I can help the other learn about it.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

A: I am doing user stories and I am present at our meetings, so I would say I'm doing as I should.

B: At this point in the process, I am having a hard time coming up with soemthing to improve, since we're basically done with sprints.

A->B: -

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

A: I have incoprorated a lot fo the abckend in the frontend so we something to demo on Monday.

B: I would like to have every part of our code in the demo, since there are someparts missing at the moment.

A->B: By making some final changes tonight, I am sure we will have more functionality to show at thte final presentations.

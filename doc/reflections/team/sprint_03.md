# Your acceptance tests, such as how they were performed, with whom, and which value they provided for you and the other stakeholders

A: At the moment, we do not have a clear setup for this, making it hard to measure how much value a user story provides.

B: We have a clear, documented process which has support from the DoD, with clear steps that give us answers regarding value. This improves transparency and it does not depend on each individuals understanding of the process.

A->B: One step is presenting this to our supervisor. The other step is sitting down during a meeting and actually producing a clear framework for how things should be done.

# The agile practices you have used and their impact on your work

A: We are using our scrum board which is very helpful in aiding us through this project. We are also having planning and reviews which gives us a clear roadmap for what we have to do each week.

B: We use some sort of variant of daily standups since we need to know more about what everyone is doing each week.

A->B: By talking to our supervisor and coming up with a helpful variant for the standups during a meeting. If we all keep track of what we're accomplishing, the overall value provided will be much higher, since eventual problems would arise quicker and therefore solved quicker as well.

# Best practices for learning and using new tools and technologies (IDEs, version control, scrum boards etc.; do not only describe which tools you used but focus on how you developed the expertise to use them)

A: We are using git with large focus on using branches correctly which is a common practice withing open-source projects, it helps us greatly when providing to the code base. When using the scrum board, we are seeing it as a utility and not something that is required for this course. This mindset makes sure that we get full use of the scrum board in developing this application. When it comes to APIs and react components, we are making sure to use the online references/documentation, and this is helpful for us as we have talked about how useful they are in pretty much every meeting. We are also using GitHub Actions for CI, which works fine, just that we have an annoying bug at the moement which hinders it from working.

B: We have a more rigorous testing environment with a test driven design mindset.

A->B: By fixing the bug which prevents our tests from ruinng. This will make CI work as intended and as something helpful for the project.

# Sprint 4 team reflection

## The chosen scope of the application under development including the priority of features and for whom you are creating value

A: The third (?) sprint we realized that for our application to have the functionality we had in mind it would need to keep track of sessions, which upon further discussion would prove an ambitious undertaking. Because of that we pivoted, so that there would be only one session running per “carpool”. The most important functionality in the application is for it to find a meeting point from the positions given as input, along with a roadmap for how to get to that point from each position. Also, the UI should be intuitive and easy to use. That is the main scope of the project, some extra functionality that will be focused on if there is time is a travel guide similar to that found in Västtrafik’s application.

B: We want to keep having a dialogue with our client about what features they find valuable, and if we should make new priorities. Depending on how much difficulty we run into in the final couple of sprints, we may have to focus on finishing one specific part of the project, leaving other parts of the original scope unfinished.

A->B: We will keep working with our current methodology because it has proved quite effective. We finish the absolute majority of our stories in time, and they are large enough to make a noticable difference in the project on a week to week basis. Will also keep incorporating our client in our work by showing the current product and ask if our priority of features are reasonable.

## The success criteria for the team in terms of what you want to achieve within the project (this can include the application, but also your learning outcomes, your teamwork, or your effort)

A: The main success criteria in terms of learning for the team is that the whole team at the end of the course wants to feel like the usage of scrum methodology was beneficial rather than a burden. As for the application itself, the group is happy so long as they have learnt or become more familiar with a certain technology. That is, the application does not have to be finished for the group to feel as if the project was a success. Some key functionalities would like to be finished though, such as finding a good meeting point.

B: In the optimal scenario, we reach the criterias set out in A.

A->B: The way we go about achieving the criterias in A is partly our weekly sprint reviews where we evaluate the scrum process for the given week. We have started to come into a good work flow in terms of our work methodology so if we continue on this trajectory, we will feel as if scrum was beneficial. The technology chosen in the project reflects the team’s wish to learn more about a given technology because it was new for everyone (typescript). Because learning and becoming more familiar with the technology is one of the main focuses of our group, we will not be afraid to experiment with the tech, even if that means a story may take a day extra.

## The three KPIs you use for monitoring your progress and how you use them to improve your 
process

A: First KPI is (stories completed / stories undertaken) which helps us evaluate if we are making reasonable estimates on the work load. If this percentage is low, then we underestimated the size of the stories. If the average is around 100 %, we will know that we are making reasonable estimates. The second KPI is just the total velocity for the sprint. It helps us see if we are undertaking a reasonable amount of work any given sprint. So far around 60 seems to be a reasonable amount to be able to complete the stories but also make noticeable progress from week to week. Last KPI is work satisfaction. Each member of the team is asked about work satisfaction on a scale from 1-5 and then the average is calculated as the KPI. Helps us keep track of the well being of the group. A low average may be a symptom of a high work load, or even a low, or something completely different which we will have to talk about and resolve.

B: We chose those KPIs because they give valuable information for they amount of effort they take to fill in. The goal is for them to serve as a guiding metric on whether we are doing well or not, both in terms of application progress, but also in terms of the mental well being of the group. Example: We had a sprint where not all stories were completed. We concluded it was because one story in particular was too large, which led us to make more detailed breakdowns of user stories, which was beneficial for the whole team. Stories became more precise.

A->B: We will keep filling in our KPIs and draw conclusions from them. If we find that one KPI is not really contributing much anymore, we will discuss what KPIs may be more valuable.

# Sprint 5 team reflection

## The chosen scope of the application under development including the priority of features and for whom you are creating value
A: During the fourth sprint we visited this question for the first time, and since then we have continued with our methodology and made sure to finish user stories in time. By that we have kept an efficient dialogue with our client about what features they find valuable and if we, as we stated last time, should make new priorities.

B: As we head towards delivery to client we want to meet the client’s needs as stated in the beginning of the project, as well as potential new needs and requirements that the client becomes aware of as the project approaches its final state.

A->B: As before, we will maintain our current way of working with our client. We will also intensify the conversation with our client in attempts to make the final product as relevant as possible for the current needs of our client.

## The success criteria for the team in terms of what you want to achieve within the project (this can include the application, but also your learning outcomes, your teamwork, or your effort)
A: In the earlier session where we discussed this topic the aim was to make every group member feel that the SCRUM-methodology is a beneficial one, as well as getting more familiar with a technology. The key functionality aimed for was to find a good meeting point. Today, this is still the case and we are aiming for the same goal to reach the scenario just explained, and we have been trying to do so through our weekly sprint meetings.

B: We want to reach the scenario explained in A.

A->B: The weekly sprints will be used as the main area for learning, as SCRUM is the concept that takes up most of the time during the sprints. Also, every member of the group is focusing on individual technologies, for example Figma.

## How your design decisions (e.g., choice of APIs, architecture patterns, behaviour) support customer value?
A: We are using an MVC-inspired work strategy. Since we are using React, however, a lot of logic is handled in components, but it works well for us. This provides customer value since we are working in an extensible environment and our previous experience makes the job easier as well. This streamlining results in us putting effort in what to implement rather than how to implement it, which creates more value for the customer.

B: We are using global states to further improve the extensiblity.

A->B: To reach B we can introduce Redux to the project, as it would make it easier to access common states that all components use rather than just passing it as props which is bug prone, since it allows for us developers to potentially forgetting or using stuff in unintended ways.

## Your social contract (Links to an external site.), i.e., the rules that define how you work together as a team, how it influenced your work, and how it evolved during the project (this means, of course, you should create one in the first week and continuously update it when the need arrives). There is a survey (Links to an external site.) you can use for evaluating how the team is perceiving the process and if it is used by several teams it will also help you to assess if your team is following a general pattern or not.
A: Our social contract has kind of been forgotten about and has not been updated since its creation. Most of the things listed there are in our opinion common decency. We also experience that the team has been open and honest with each other since day one and the overall team spirit is good. The main thing that has changed since its creation are how meetings are set. Today we have fixed meeting times, whereas in the contract it says the next meeting is scheduled at the end of a meeting. We’ve also added how potential conflicts should be handled. 

B: Social contracts should instill a sense of trust, accountability, and team work within the team.

A->B: By keeping being honest with each other we uphold an implicit social contract that is not printed in text.

## The time you have spent on the course and how it relates to what you delivered
A: We have not kept track of all working hours but we do have a good indication of overall workload that has been completed by looking at our planned velocity and how much of it we completed. In the first couple of sprints the planned velocity was quite low, and over the weeks it has increased without causing many failed user stories. With the stories becoming more advanced as the week progresses, this is a good sign that our process has improved and that we have become comfortable working with our product.

B: As the weeks progress, the work we get out of any given work hour should increase.

A->B: By continuing to be reflective on our weekly sprint reviews and think about how we can improve our process.

## The roles you have used within the team and their impact on your work
A: We have the traditional roles of SM, PO, and Devs. We also have some people that have been more focused on the UI and frontend, whereas others have been more focused on the backend. This has been beneficial because we all become familiar with our area over time, which leads to higher productivity, something we’ve noticed increase over the weeks. But we also brief each other on the different areas and sometimes may take on a user story not in our “area”.

B: The roles outside of SM, PO, and Devs (i.e. frontend-focus, backend-focus, or UI etc.) should be such that they increase the overall productivity of the team, but team members should have the opportunity to work in a different area if they wish.

A->B: By keeping the current roles we have. These roles came naturally as the project developed because many times team members wanted to keep building on what they had been doing the week before.

## The sprint review and how it relates to your scope and customer value (Did you have a PO, if yes, who?, if no, how did you carry out the review? Did the review result in a re-prioritisation of user stories? How did the reviews relate to your DoD? Did the feedback change your way of working?)
A: We realized in sprint 3(?) that implementing sessions in the app would be an ambitious goal given the time we have left. After speaking with our client we agreed on not implementing sessions and only running the app locally to be able to deploy the product in time. This was fine with the customer because he would rather we finish something semigood than not finishing something that would be better.

B: The sprint reviews should help the team become aware of any adjustments that need to be made in our work process in order to increase productivity in the next sprint. 

A->B: By having weekly sprint reviews where we reflect as a team on what went well during the sprint and what could have gone better and how.

##  Relation to literature and guest lectures (how do your reflections relate to what others have to say?)
A: Much of our learning is a combination of lectures and our own experiences in our sprints. For example, from lectures we knew it would be a good idea to break a user story down into very small components which was confirmed for us in an early sprint where it became obvious that some stories were just way too big for a single sprint.

B: We want the reflections to mainly be based on our own experiences working with scrum but studying related literature can certainly help facilitate discussion within the team to come up with valuable improvements.

A->B: By studying some related literature to facilitate discussions within the team.

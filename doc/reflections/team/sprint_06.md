# Sprint 6 team reflection
## How you ensure code quality and enforce coding standards.
A: We mainly develop the application in different branches, and make sure each one of these are properly reviewed before merging with the main branch. Additionally, we have a contributing guide as well as a code formating guide which help us ensure a consistency on commits and code contributions. Although, as we approach the end of the project and the deadline to provide a sufficent MVP, requirements on quality of individual parts of code might have lowered.

B: Additional requirements on reviewing code as well as more developed automation on testing would be preferable, and making sure our code keeps a high standard.

A -> B: Take the time to properly review our code and try keep in mind the importance of good code quality

## How you use and update your documentation throughout the sprints

A: The documentation is currently used to reflect the project as a whole. This includes instructions
for running the application in such a way that it behaves the same way for everyone. There are 
also guidelines for contributing to the project which lies as basis for every feature. As a
consequence, inconsistent structure and code is avoided. Some parts of the documentation 
have not been updated correctly to correspond with the project's current status, although
these may also be related to deprecated parts of the application and are therefore not 
considered relevant anymore. Otherwise, the documentation regarding relevant parts 
(such as the readme) are updated when new features affect the usage of these parts.

B: The goal with the documentation is to provide a relevant and insightful view into the
current structure and usage/development of the application. It should be used as a base for implementing new 
major features and the documentation should be updated accordingly. This might include instructions
that describe how to use the application in its current state or describing the components
which hold it together. Updates are made when features change the application or add new
components which are considered to be too complex to be understood by looking at them. 
Additionaly updates are made when overhauls of or changes to the current work process are 
implemented.

A -> B: Make it a habit to document complex features and update outdated documentation
as the project progresses. Evaluate the comprehensibility as the documentation's usage is not
necessarily restricted to its author. Check the relevancy of documentation to avoid cluttering.

## How your design decisions (e.g., choice of APIs, architecture patterns, behavior) support customer value?

A: Using mapbox as a map API is very beneficial for customer value, as it provides a lot of the functionality we need (map themes, getting coordinates etc), which saves a lot of time. This gives us the opportunity to work on the things which are unique for our project, which increases productivity, resulting in higher customer value.

B: Using even more functionality of mapbox would increase customer value, as we need to write less code, which results in more value per time unit.

A-> B: By reserching the documentation of mapbox, we would find stuff that could help us rather than us implementing it on our own.

## The agile practices you have used and their impact on your work

A: As earlier reflected upon, we are using SCRUM as the tool for keeping an agile workflow. The use of SCRUM allows us to constantly and regularly reflect upon our direction of work. To that, we have tried to implement a more informal way of reflecting - so called “standups”. These efforts have not reached the level that we aimed for and we are still working on it.

B: We increase the quality of and the frequency of “standups”, which logically would improve the quality of our deliverables to our client. It would also contribute to making it easier to coordinate the different areas being worked on at once, but also minimizing potential misconceptions about a given user story so that everybody are aware of how the user story fits in with the project as a whole.

A -> B: As we head towards the end of the project, everybody’s knowledge about our shared accomplishments grows more important. Therefore, we will work closer with each other and share our perspectives to increase the quality and knowledge of our work.

## Your user stories in terms of using a standard pattern, acceptance criteria, task breakdown and effort estimation and how this influenced the way you worked and created value

A: Our current user stories are of the format "As an X I want Y so that I can Z". Along side that we have clear acceptance criterias to make sure that, when completed, the required functionality has been added. We think we have done a good job of keeping the stories independent of each other so that people can do work without having to meticulousy coordinate with a person working on another. Each story is tagged with a small/medium/large and a velocity number. The color tag helps with the Trello overview so that we can easily see which stories may require help.

B: We would like to increase the "verticality" of the stories so that each completed story adds a tiny bit of functionality in all parts of the app. This would hopefully make a minimal viable product available earlier. We would also like for everybody to be able to help fix issues found within any given part of the code. Although our stories have largely been of a horizontal nature, our sprints as a whole have been more vertical where the stories we undertake any given sprint cover the whole layering of our product.

A -> B: We accomplish B by making the whole team aware of how each part of the product is built, so that we are familiar with the interfaces in each of the different parts (frontend/backend etc.). This would be one of the things we would keep in mind from the start if we were to do another project.

## Your social contract (Links to an external site.), i.e., the rules that define how you work together as a team, how it influenced your work, and how it evolved during the project (this means, of course, you should create one in the first week and continuously update it when the need arrives). There is a survey (Links to an external site.) you can use for evaluating how the team is perceiving the process and if it is used by several teams it will also help you to assess if your team is following a general pattern or not.

A: The social contract has been updated and shows our meeting times and the purpose of each type of meeting. The communication within the group functions well and everybody are familiar with our current working process, which is why we are currently not dependent on looking at the social contract to make sure that everybody are on the same page.

B: Social contracts should instill a sense of trust, accountability, and team work within the team. The contract should also be updated as things in the contract change.

A -> B: Keep having an open dialogue within the group about our processes, and make sure to update the social contract accordingly. Don't view it as something that just has to be there for the sake of it, appreciate its purpose.

## The time you have spent on the course and how it relates to what you delivered (so keep track of your hours so you can describe the current situation)

A: The team has spent a lot of time this week making the application ready for demo, more time than a typical sprint. More work than what was estimated in the sprint has been done, because of bugs risen from merges along with small fixes that were difficult to predict at the start of the sprint.

B: We want the work load to be consistent over the sprints.

A -> B: By thinking ahead and trying to better predict what issues may present themselves in the future. This allows for us to take this into account the sprints leading up to delivery. The key here may be to add have a bit longer sprint reviews the weeks leading up to delivery where we make a conscious effort to predict issues and/or smaller tasks not obvious today.

## The sprint review and how it relates to your scope and customer value (Did you have a PO, if yes, who?, if no, how did you carry out the review? Did the review result in a re-prioritisation of user stories? How did the reviews relate to your DoD? Did the feedback change your way of working?)

A: Along with the reprioritization we did with sessions we recently decided together with our client not to make the meeting point weighted towards the destination (so that the meeting point would land more close to the final destination). Instead we decided that it would be better to have a finished product that actually works but where there is room for improvement that we are fully aware of which would be taken care of if time allows for it. The client likes the user interface.

B: We want to keep having regualar contact with our client about the prioritiztion of features, and also give them a semi-functioning demo on a more regular basis. This will hopefully lead to the client becoming even more familiar with the product which may make them come up with more ideas and/or changes that ought to be made.

A -> B: By finishing a minimal viable product earlier that the client can easily set up and try on their own machine. Making sure to send them a demo after any significant progress has been made.

## Relation to literature and guest lectures (how do your reflections relate to what others have to say?)

A: In order to decide what questions to discuss during our sprint reviews we drew inspiration from ScrumDesks "Sprint Review Best Practices". This allowed for us to come up with meaningful questions that have contributed to making our work better. When questions have arisen within the group on how to do some scrum-related thing we have mostly consulted internet resources.

B: The literature should inspire us and facilitate discussion within the group.

A -> B: Byt studying a bit of literature on our own, making sure to do a google-search if something is unclear and share with the group if it is relevant.

## Which technical documentation you use and why (e.g. use cases, interaction diagrams, class diagrams, domain models or component diagrams, text documents)
A: As of right now we are using a diagram for describing how our app should be structured regarding files and their interaction between one another but it is not very detailed. We also use a contribution guide which is used when naming variabels, classes, functions, files and more. These are taken into consideration when we continue with our development in order to make the code more cohesive and extendable. Our code documentation as of right now is lacking and could use some comments explaining what parts of the code do.

B: We would like to have a more in-depth diagram with dependensies showing which parts of the code that depend on other parts. This will help us with producing better code that  is easier to extend and less prone to bugs. We would like to have better documented code in order for other developers on the team to use the existing code base without having the  author of the code with them.

A -> B: By setting aside more time for planning in the beginning of the project we could produce a more detailed diagram of our code. The produced diagram will  probably differ a bit from the code but if we would update it along the way during meetings it would probably help us a lot when designing new features and extending the code. During the sprints it would also help if we set some time aside towards the end for documenting the code that has been produced during that sprint.

## The three KPIs you use for monitoring your progress and how you use them to improve your process
A: We experience the KPIs are somewhat arbitrary and some of them are in need of further specification, such as the work satisfaction KPI.

B: We would like for the KPIs to not be as arbitrary as we experience them today. The goal is for tem to serve as a guiding metric on how well we are doing, both in terms of application progress, but also in terms of overall satisfaction within the group. We also should have evaluated the KPIs at some point to find flaws in them, such as them not being specific enough, so that we can improve them and hopefully have them contribute in a more meaningful way.

A -> B: We should have specified early in our process what 1 velocity actually means, possibly in terms of working hours, rather than the current intuitive gut feeling we are using which is different for everyone. The work satisfaction KPI should have had a clearer specification on what each number 1 through 5 actually entails in terms of work satisfaction and what an acceptable average is. We should have had a meeting mid-project to evaluate the KPIs to have potential flaws come to the surface quicker.

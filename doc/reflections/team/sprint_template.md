... the current situation or "what is" (A),

... what you want the situation to be or "what might or should be" (B), and

... a plan for getting from where you are to where you want to be or "feedback designed to reduce the gap" (A -> B).


### The chosen scope of the application under development including the priority of features and for whom you are creating value

### The success criteria for the team in terms of what you want to achieve within the project (this can include the application, but also your learning outcomes, your teamwork, or your effort)

### Your user stories in terms of using a standard pattern, acceptance criteria, task breakdown and effort estimation and how this influenced the way you worked and created value

### Your acceptance tests, such as how they were performed, with whom, and which value they provided for you and the other stakeholders

### The three KPIs you use for monitoring your progress and how you use them to improve your process

### Your social contract (Links to an external site.), i.e., the rules that define how you work together as a team, how it influenced your work, and how it evolved during the project (this means, of course, you should create one in the first week and continuously update it when the need arrives). There is a survey (Links to an external site.) you can use for evaluating how the team is perceiving the process and if it is used by several teams it will also help you to assess if your team is following a general pattern or not.

### The time you have spent on the course and how it relates to what you delivered (so keep track of your hours so you can describe the current situation)

### How your design decisions (e.g., choice of APIs, architecture patterns, behaviour) support customer value?

### Which technical documentation you use and why (e.g. use cases, interaction diagrams, class diagrams, domain models or component diagrams, text documents)

### How you use and update your documentation throughout the sprints

### How you ensure code quality and enforce coding standards

### The roles you have used within the team and their impact on your work

### The agile practices you have used and their impact on your work

### The sprint review and how it relates to your scope and customer value (Did you have a PO, if yes, who?, if no, how did you carry out the review? Did the review result in a re-prioritisation of user stories? How did the reviews relate to your DoD? Did the feedback change your way of working?)

### Best practices for learning and using new tools and technologies (IDEs, version control, scrum boards etc.; do not only describe which tools you used but focus on how you developed the expertise to use them)

### Relation to literature and guest lectures (how do your reflections relate to what others have to say?)

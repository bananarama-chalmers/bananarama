# Reflection \[1]

Weeky individual reflection, week \[1], Ludvig

## What do I want to learn or understand better?

A: I currently have a vague idea of what SCRUM entails, such as the different roles and the idea of using an iterative process rather than one single, long process.

B: I want to learn what the advantages of using SCRUM are, and become comfortable with it enough such that I can apply it in different projects other than for software development.

A->B: I will read some of the recommended literature to get an understanding of SCRUM as a complement to what is offered on lectures.

## How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

A: I am currently unsure on what competences I have that other project members do not.

B: I want to help increase the collective knowledge of SCRUM in the group.

A->B: I will share resources and encourage team members to take a look at these if I find them (resources) particularly helpful.

## What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

A: I have helped the team keep track of the initial deadlines and took responsibility for delivering the intitial group assignment (social contract).

B: I want to be a team member that is well familiar with SCRUM fundamentals and set up a well working work-flow for the group, such as finding relevant and useful online tools to use within the group. Also possibly take on a leading role.

A->B: Find relevant online tools, gather a good understanding of SCRUM fundamentals, (possibly scrum master?).

## What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

A: Was responsible to turn in the initial team assignment, and reminded team members of the first individual reflection.

B: I want to help with organizing within the group, but also be well versed in the code used in the project, and also contribute with decent code.

A->B: Will make an effort to be part of setting up a good work flow for the group. I will also keep myself updated on the code base on a week to week basis so that I can contribute with code.
